- As a user, I want to be able to search my destination so that I can see what parking is available.
- As a person looking for a spot, I want to be able to book a location so that I know that it is only available to me.
- As a person that cares for my car, I want a secure parking spot so that my car is safe.
- As a person looking for a parking spot, I want to be able to see parking spots on a map so that I can visually see the distance from the spot to the destination and choose the closest one. 
- As a person that is travelling, I want a parking spot that is more flexible than public parking so that I can park closer to my destination.
- As a busy person, I want a parking spot that is easier to access so that I can get to my vehicle more quickly.
- As a returning user, I want to be able to see previous bookings, so that I can book the same spot again at a later date. 
- As a concerned user, I want to be able to rate a parking spot so that other users can see if it is a good/bad location.
- As a power user I want to be able to choose how long I can reserve a parking spot, so that can keep my vehicle at a location for extended periods of time. 
- For example a whole month.As the manager, I want to be able to see information such as location, price, time and availability so I know what I can offer to my customers.
- As a manager, I want to be able to manage all bookings so that I can add, edit and remove bookings with ease.
